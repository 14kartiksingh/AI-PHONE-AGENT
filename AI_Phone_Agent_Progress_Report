Hackathon Progress Report

Introduction

The challenge was to build an AI phone agent capable of making cold calls, holding meaningful conversations, and closing sales. The agent was expected to be fast, deliver high-quality, natural-sounding voice interactions, and handle multiple calls simultaneously. Due to late awareness of the hackathon, we started the project just a few days before the submission deadline.

Approach

We planned to develop the solution from scratch without relying on APIs to showcase technical skills and originality. Our approach included the following steps:

Set up the Environment:

Install and configure Asterisk on a Kali Linux virtual machine for managing VoIP communication.

Set up a SIP client (Zoiper) to simulate a user interface for the phone agent.

Integrate Communication Components:

Establish connectivity between the SIP server (Asterisk) and the client (Zoiper) for voice communication.

Configure dynamic registration of clients using configuration files.

Implement AI for Conversations:

Develop an AI module to handle voice-to-text and text-to-voice conversion.

Train a natural language understanding (NLU) model to manage conversations and respond intelligently.

Simulate Sales Flow:

Design a conversation script to guide the AI agent through a sales call, including greeting, identifying customer needs, and closing sales.

Test and Optimize:

Test the system for low latency, voice clarity, and concurrent call handling.

Optimize for performance and user experience.

Progress

Successfully installed and configured Asterisk on Kali Linux.

Established connectivity between Zoiper and Asterisk on the same machine.

Configured SIP clients dynamically with the necessary authentication.

Explored initial steps for integrating voice recognition and synthesis.

Challenges

Time Constraints:

We discovered the hackathon late, leaving insufficient time to complete the project.

Technical Barriers:

Limited familiarity with Asterisk and SIP configurations resulted in delays.

Lack of pre-configured APIs or tools meant longer development cycles.

Concurrent Setup Issues:

Difficulty in connecting devices on different networks for testing.

Next Steps

If given more time, we would:

Complete the integration of AI modules for dynamic conversation management.

Optimize the system for handling multiple concurrent calls with low latency.

Enhance voice quality using advanced codecs and tuning.

Deploy the solution on a public server for live demonstrations.

Conclusion

While we could not complete the project on time, this hackathon has been a valuable learning experience. We explored Asterisk, SIP protocols, and voice interaction systems in depth. With more preparation, we are confident we could deliver a robust, high-quality solution. Thank you for this opportunity to innovate and learn!
